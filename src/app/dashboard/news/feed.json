        "published": "<p></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Multi-reader studies are a popular tool for radiology researchers as they look to label images to build and refine AI models, among other applications. But administering these unique studies is often complex, time-consuming, and data-intensive. One of the greatest challenges researchers face is designing reader workflows and providing an intuitive interface that helps them complete their assigned tasks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Many common tools used in multi-reader studies aren&rsquo;t built to solve these problems&mdash;they&rsquo;re built for a few rigid purposes, leaving the researcher to cobble together a workflow specific to their needs. While standard read protocols, such as the RECIST Protocol, are available for researchers to leverage, the ability to design their own custom guided workflows aimed at novel hypotheses is not. This means researchers invest significant upfront time creating data capture systems external to the viewer and training readers to ensure accurate and adequate data capture throughout the study.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ideally, blind readers should be presented with a guided workflow inside the viewer that solicits the necessary information without extraneous tools, form questions, or distractions. Researchers should be able to design these custom workflows without coding knowledge and with the confidence they are staying in compliance.</span></p><h2><strong>Bringing Focus and Simplicity to Multi-Reader Studies&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Flywheel&rsquo;s highly configurable interface for multi-reader studies is built to solve the challenges of these studies for both administrators and readers.&nbsp;</span></p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CAnJGQUb2oY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p></p><p></p><p><strong>On the setup side</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, the researcher has broad customization abilities, allowing them to create a data capture form built into the viewer that captures their readers&rsquo; interpretations with advanced logic for displaying sets of questions and requiring annotations based on form responses. For example, the logic can require an annotation with a predefined label as well as the annotation tool type to be used. </span>In addition, the researcher is able to change nearly any aspect of the <a href=\"https://ohif.org/\">OHIF viewer</a> to suit it to the readers&rsquo; tasks. Options include hiding unwanted tools, defining custom hanging protocols, and designating slice specific workflows to be completed. With these capabilities, researchers can create custom workflows to guide the reader easily through each step ensuring optimal data capture and reader experience.</p><div id=\"attachment_87108\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"Setting custom hanging protocol for a reader study\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87108\" src=\"https://flywheel.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Custom-hanging-protocol-multi-reader-studies.gif\" style=\"height:451px; width:800px\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87108\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-87108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Researchers can set custom hanging protocols and define slice specific workflows. In this example, the hanging protocol is asymmetrical and mixed 2D and 2D MPR viewports to navigate in three planes. When the user is on a promoted slice, a border appears around the 2D viewport and the study summary form populates for that slice.</em></p></div><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><strong>On the reader side</strong>, the streamlined interface solicits the necessary information and minimizes unnecessary tools or form fields. This purpose-built interface minimizes confusion and frustration, improving the user experience for readers and helping them complete their assigned tasks efficiently. Blinding is also maintained through a series of role-based permissions so that the reader does not have access to other reader data or additional information about the subject. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">With these capabilities, Flywheel users at institutions of all sizes can more efficiently design and administer multi-reader studies. This opens new doors to collaboration outside of an organization&rsquo;s walls, and can help speed discovery with a platform that is friendly to both researchers and readers.&nbsp;</span></p><div id=\"attachment_87109\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"Custom logic for a multi-reader study determines the tool type and followup questions\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87109\" src=\"https://flywheel.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Custom-logic-multi-reader-studies.gif\" style=\"height:451px; width:800px\" class=\"size-full wp-image-87109\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-87109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Multi-reader study administrators can define advanced custom logic for requiring specific annotations and/or displaying additional fields based on form field responses.

A label of &ldquo;IB-RPE&rdquo; is automatically applied and the next confirmation question is displayed.</em></p></div><p></p>",

        "published": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Federated learning holds the potential to dramatically accelerate machine learning in healthcare. This emerging AI training method changes how researchers access data and reduces challenges with compliance and data privacy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Traditionally, researchers training AI models have had to acquire and </span><strong>centralize</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> large amounts of data to test and train their algorithms. This means that </span><strong>data has to travel </strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">outside the possession of its original owner. Federated learning projects invert this model with </span><strong>decentralized </strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">training&mdash;</span><strong>the algorithm travels instead of the data</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For biomedical researchers, this reduces concerns with deidentification and other compliance issues, as the data itself never leaves its owner. AI researchers can better train their models by accessing distributed, diverse data instead of being limited to what they can acquire and centralize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2>Flywheel&rsquo;s Federated Learning Project Success</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Flywheel recently facilitated a federated learning project between a pharmaceutical company and a university healthcare provider, a case study that helps illustrate the potential of this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For this federated learning project, two Flywheel sites&mdash;one within an academic medical center, another at a pharmaceutical company&mdash;ingested a large volume of chest x-ray data. Flywheel&rsquo;s containerized algorithms (referred to as Gears) automated preprocessing of the x-ray images to prepare them for machine learning&mdash;extracting the metadata, validating with QC, adjusting intensity scaling, and resizing. The containerized and version-controlled Flywheel Gears ensured consistency in the data preparation, a critical need for machine learning.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">With the data consistently prepared, machine learning researchers at the pharmaceutical company could then train their AI model on the chest x-rays. Using NVIDIA Flare, PyTorch, and the Flywheel Dataset API, researchers created their training method and sent their model to the sites. These sites received the model from the server, trained it using their respective data, and sent weighted scores back to the pharma researchers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">AI developers and data scientists can see more technical details about this process in our video.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"container\"><iframe align=\"middle\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"responsive-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"608\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-EKZC4yvY4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://flywheel.io\" title=\"Flywheel &amp; NVIDIA FLARE Demo\" width=\"800\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This collaboration is just one example of how organizations can bring their data and algorithms together to advance healthcare innovation. With Flywheel facilitating collaborations between institutions and enabling consistent curation of data, researchers can more efficiently train their models, and can gain access to a greater volume of data to ensure accuracy. And with Flywheel Exchange, researchers will soon be able to </span><a href=\"https://flywheel.io/exchange/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">more easily discover data and collaborators for their own federated learning projects</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

By doing so, other slices are set to &ldquo;read only&rdquo; so readers are unable to draw ROIs and no forms would display for them to complete. Once they navigate to a slice that has been promoted for specific workflows, it becomes &ldquo;read-write&rdquo; and a special form displays for that single slice.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The viewer&rsquo;s toolbar configuration can be customized to either include or exclude any of the tool options using &ldquo;except&rdquo; or &ldquo;only&rdquo; logic. For example, selecting </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measurements</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and specifying &ldquo;only&rdquo; and &ldquo;length&rdquo; would remove angle and bidirectional tools from the menu. Fully customizable &ldquo;hot keys&rdquo; allow you to increase your efficiency by defining keystrokes and mouse actions for tools such as WWWC presets and UI actions.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support for Data Quality and AI Research</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flywheel&rsquo;s imaging research solutions can be easily used for AI research frameworks, allowing imaging researchers to construct configurable workflows for multiple readers, while simplifying measurements, data capture, and workflow status.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OCT viewer supports blinded reader studies with customizable labels and annotations and task assignment workflows. You can customize forms in the viewer for clinical data capture. Customized workflow configuration forms can include data capture using logic rules such as required answer (annotations, measurement, etc.), multiple choice, and conditional display of a field based on a previous answer.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrators can configure Flywheel&rsquo;s platform to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automatically assign readers tasks via </span><a href=\"https://flywheel.io/gear-exchange/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gears</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The collected form data and annotation is automatically saved and indexed on the session, and can be collected back to master projects.

Flywheel provides us with a platform so we can continue to support our researchers across the university and they can remain highly productive in driving important research studies forward,&rdquo;</span></h4>\n\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; Dr. Jonas Kaplan, Co-Director of the Dornsife Neuroimaging Center</span></h4>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shared Remote Access</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flywheel is a </span><a href=\"https://flywheel.io/product/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cloud-based research data platform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that makes study data and clinical data easily accessible to all contributors. Users may build automated pre-processing pipelines and set custom de-identification rules that run once data is collected, protecting privacy and making all data analysis-ready.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the enormous advances in cloud computing, researchers might have to log in to a remote computer system and make a local copy of the data. It would be complex to preserve the full value of the curated Flywheel data and metadata on a local copy, including organized tags and measurement parameters. If two or more people are working on the project together, each with their own local copy, differences and errors will creep in that will limit the reproducibility of the analyses. To work on shared datasets in Flywheel, users simply log in to the secure web interface with their institutional credentials. Flywheel gives users a HIPAA and IRB compliant tool that allows them to work with the complete data and metadata collaboratively and reproducibly with colleagues who are also working remotely.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backing up data on home systems also presents a security concern. Sensitive medical data must be carefully stored by healthcare professionals to reduce the risk of data leaks. As a SOC 2 certified organization, Flywheel provides remote access to a secure system that ensures data privacy, confidentiality and processing integrity.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploratory Development and Analysis</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flywheel&rsquo;s computational management allows researchers to securely use conventional algorithms or develop original algorithms while working remotely.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers can perform analyses on the cloud, including over 70 plug-in algorithms (called Gears) in the </span><a href=\"https://flywheel.io/gear-exchange/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flywheel Gear Exchange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or privately-shared Gears on a user&rsquo;s instance of Flywheel. Gears may be run on-demand for a given dataset or in batch mode for a selected collection of datasets. Flywheel&rsquo;s comprehensive provenance captures all analytical derivative information to support the consistency and reproducibility of your project. If you are developing your own algorithms, you can use the Python SDK, MATLAB SDK, or command-line interface to read and analyze data and metadata from Flywheel and store your analyses in the Flywheel system.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flywheel&rsquo;s built-in image viewers also support remote work, making it possible to see the results of different analyses either as images or through quantitative graphical plotting methods. The results of the remote analyses can be downloaded and inserted in reports and publications.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about Flywheel&rsquo;s research data management platform and how it supports working remotely, please </span><a href=\"https://flywheel.io/demo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">click to schedule a demo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
